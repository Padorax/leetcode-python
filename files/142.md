### Solution 1
```python
class Solution(object):
    def detectCycle(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        # store each visited node
        visited = set()
        while head:
            # store this node if we haven't seen it
            if head not in visited:
                visited.add(head)
                head = head.next
            else:
            # otherwise we find entry of circle
                return head
        
        return None
```
### Solution 2
fast and slow pointer, floyd cycle detection
```python
def detectCycle(head):
    if not head: return None
    
    fast, slow = head, head
    while slow.next and fast.next and fast.next.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        # find entry point
        if slow == fast:
            slow = head
            while slow != fast:
                slow = slow.next
                fast = fast.next
            return slow
    
    return None
```
