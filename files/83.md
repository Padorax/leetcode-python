### Solution 1 82
Similar to [82](82.md), except that we need to keep one duplicate.
* 1. Iteration
```python
class Solution(object):
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        if not head: return head
        # d for dummy, p for pre, c for current
        d = ListNode(0)
        d.next = head
        p = d
        c = head

        while c:
            while c.next and c.next.val == c.val:
                c = c.next
            if p.next is c:
                p = p.next
            else:
                p.next = c
                p = c
            c = c.next

        return d.next 
```
* 2. Recusion
```python
class Solution(object):
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        if head.next and head.val == head.next.val:
            while head.next and head.val == head.next.val:
                head = head.next
            return self.deleteDuplicates(head)
        else:
            head.next = self.deleteDuplicates(head.next)
            return head
```
### Solution 2 Iteration
Note we keep one of the duplicates, so we do not need to save the previous node. Besides, instead of finding all duplicates, we can delete only one node at a time.
```python
class Solution(object):
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        cur = head
        while cur and cur.next:
            # delete next node if the value is same as current node 
            if cur.next.val == cur.val:
                cur.next = cur.next.next
            # if different value move forward
            else:
                cur = cur.next
        
        return head
```
+ Time complexity: O(n)
+ Space complexity: O(1)

### Solution 3 Recursion
```python
class Solution(object):
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        if not head or (not head.next):
            return head
        # head value is the same as next node
        if head.val == head.next.val:
            # remove head
            return self.deleteDuplicates(head.next)
        else:
            # attach head
            head.next = self.deleteDupicates(head.next)
            return head
```
