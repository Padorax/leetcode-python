### Solution
One way is to repeatedly move the front node to the rear for k times, a faster solution is find the rotation point and swap the two part. For ex, [1 2 3 | 4 5] -> [4 5 | 1 2 3]
```python
class Solution(object):
    def rotateRight(self, head, k):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type k: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        def getLen(head):
            l = 0
            while head:
                head = head.next
                l += 1
            return l
        
        if not head: return head
        
        l = getLen(head)
        k %= l
        
        if l < 2 or k == 0: return head
        
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head
        tail, start = dummy, dummy
        # We let "tail" k nodes advance of "start"
        for i in range(k):
            tail = tail.next
        while tail.next:
            start = start.next
            tail = tail.next
        # tail now points to end of list, start points to the front of rotation point

        # relink
        dummy.next = start.next
        start.next = None
        tail.next = head
    
        return dummy.next

```
