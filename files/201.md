### Solution 1 WA
A naive one:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = n
        for i in range(m, n):
            res = res & i
        return res
```
### Solution 2
Refer to [here](https://leetcode.wang/leetcode-201-Bitwise-AND-of-Numbers-Range.html) and [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/discuss/56729/Bit-operation-solution(JAVA)).

The hardest part of this problem is to find the regular pattern.
For example, for number 26 to 30
Their binary form are:
```
11|010
11|011
11|100　　
11|101　　
11|110
```
Because we are trying to find bitwise AND, so if any bit there are at least one 0 and one 1, it always 0. In this case, it is 11000.
So we are go to cut all these bit that they are different. In this case we cut the right 3 bit.<br>
In one word, this problem is asking us to find the `common prefix` of m and n 's binary code.
```python
class Solution(object):
    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, m, n):
        i = 0 #i means we have how many bits are 0 on the right
        while m != n:
            m >>= 1
            n >>= 1
            i += 1
        return m << i
```
