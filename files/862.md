### Solution 2

```
If we have an array prefix sum array like [0,1,2,3,4,10,7,4,5,14,16,....... ], K=11
The best answer is: length=2 (i=8, j=10).

For the subarray [4,10,7,4], do we need the first three elements 4,10,7? We don't, if we have presum[j]-10>=K, presum[j]-4(later one) is also larger than K and has a shorter length. Therefore, the elements we want to use in the inner loop are actually like [0,1,2,3,**4(later one),**5,14,16, ......]. When we visit later 4 in the outer loop, we can remove previous elements that are larger than 4. What we get will be a ascent array.

The first answer we found will be length=6 (i=3, j=9). After we find this answer, do we still need the elements 0,1,2? We don't. Since the next answer must be shorter than this one, we don't need to compare later element with these elements. Now, the array will be [3, 4, 5, 14, 16, .....]

Then, when we visit 16 in the outer loop. And we will sequentially visit and remove 3,4 in the inner loop. Finally, we get the best answer (i=8, j=10).

Okay, there are two steps we need to reduce redundant calculations.

Remove previous elements that are larger than the current one ( second while loop ).
If we find an answer (i, j), remove smaller elements than presum[i]. Since we have keep elements in ascent order with the first step, we can just remove previous elements before i ( fisrt while loop ).
Since we only need to remove head or tail elements, Deque will be a great data structure.

```python
import collections
def shortestSubarray(A, K):
    d = collections.deque([[0, 0]])
    res, cur = float('inf'), 0
    for i, a in enumerate(A):
        cur += a
        while d and cur - d[0][1] >= K:
            res = min(res, i + 1 - d.popleft()[0])
        while d and cur <= d[-1][1]:
            d.pop()
        d.append([i + 1, cur])
    return res if res < float('inf') else -1
